Beware:
Concerns the "parse the pretty printed text again" test.
The " b &lt;div> c " part will be pulled in front of the table.
The "a " is in a paragraph, the table contents will appear on a NEW LINE
after the paragraph. When pretty printing the " b" will be at the start of a line.
It will be parsed as SEMI PRE!
