== Etymology ==
{{Main|Name of France}}
{{See also|List of country name etymologies}}

The word "Frank" had been loosely used from the fall of Rome to the Middle Ages, yet from [[Hugh Capet]]'s coronation as "King of the Franks" ("Rex Francorum") it became usual to strictly refer to the [[Kingdom of France|Kingdom of Francia]], which would become France. The [[House of Capet|Capetian Kings]] were descended from the [[Robertians|Robertines]], who had produced two Frankish kings, and previously held the title of "[[Duke of the Franks]]" ("dux Francorum"). [[Île-de-France (region)|This Frankish duchy]] encompassed most of modern [[Neustria|northern France]] but because the royal power was sapped by regional princes the term was then applied to the royal [[demesne]] as shorthand. It was finally the name adopted for the entire Kingdom as central power was affirmed over the entire kingdom.<ref>Elizabeth M. Hallam & Judith Everard – Capetian France 937–1328, chapter 1 "The origins of Western Francia" page 7: "What did the name Francia mean in the tenth and eleventh centuries? It still retained a wide general use; both Byzantine and western writers at the time of the crusades described the western forces as Franks. But it was also taking on more specific meanings. From 911 onwards the west Frankish king was known as the ''Rex Francorum'' -king of the Franks- and the name Francia could be used to describe his kingdom, as it was also used by the east Frankish, or German, kingdom... The Robertines, forerunners of the Capetians, were ''duces francorum'', dukes of the Franks, and their 'duchy' covered in theory most of northern France. Then as royal power contracted further, leaving the early Capetians only a small bloc of lands around Paris and Orleans, the term Francia was used for this region."</ref>

The name "France" itself comes from [[Latin]] ''Francia'', which literally means "land of the [[Franks]]," or "country of the Franks".<ref>[http://www.discoverfrance.net/France/History/DF_history.shtml History of France] on DiscoverFrance</ref> There are various theories as to the origin of the name of the Franks. One is that it is derived from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] word ''frankon'' which translates as ''javelin'' or ''lance'' as the throwing axe of the Franks was known as a [[francisca]].<ref>{{cite book |last2=Blair |first2=Claude |last1=Tarassuk |first1=Leonid |url=http://books.google.com/?id=UJbyPwAACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Encyclopedia+of+Arms+and+Weapons&cd=1 |year=1982 |title=The Complete Encyclopedia of Arms and Weapons: the most comprehensive reference work ever published on arms and armor from prehistoric times to the present with over 1,250 illustrations |page=186 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |isbn=067142257X}}</ref> Another proposed etymology is that in an ancient [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]], Frank means ''free'' as opposed to [[slave]]. This usage still survives in the name of the national currency prior to the adoption of the [[euro]], the [[French franc|franc]].

However, it is also possible that the word is derived from the ethnic name of the Franks,<ref>{{Cite paper |last1=Reisman |first1=Arnold |last2=Saha |first2=P.K. |authorlink1=Arnold Reisman |title=French as Lingua Franca: An Asset or Liability in the Development of Nations?{{ndash}} page 2 |url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=690221 |format=PDF |date=21 March 2005 |publisher=Social Science Research Network (SSRN) |accessdate=7 March 2010 |postscript={{ndash}} '''click on "One-Click Download"'''}}</ref> because as the conquering class only the Franks had the status of freemen. In German (and other Germanic language, such as Scandinavian languages and Dutch), France is still called "[[Frankish Realm|Realm of the Franks]]" (''Frankreich'', ''Frankrike'', ''Frankrige''). In order to distinguish from the Frankish Empire of [[Charlemagne]], Modern France is called ''Frankreich'' in German, while the Frankish Realm is called ''Frankenreich''. In some languages, such as [[Greek language|Greek]], France is still known as ''Gaul''.

=== Rome to Revolution ===
The borders of modern France are approximately the same as those of ancient [[Gaul]], which was inhabited by [[Celt]]ic ''Gauls''. Gaul was conquered by [[Roman Empire|Rome]] under [[Julius Caesar]] in the 1st century BC,<ref>[[Plutarch]] claimed that one million people (probably 1 in 4 of the [[Gauls]]) died, another million were enslaved, 300 tribes were subjugated and 800 cities were destroyed during the [[Gallic Wars]].</ref> and the Gauls eventually adopted [[Romance languages|Roman]] speech ([[Latin]], from which the [[French language]] evolved) and Roman culture. [[History of Christianity|Christianity]] first appeared in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, and became so firmly established by the fourth and 5th centuries that [[St. Jerome]] wrote that Gaul was the only region “free from heresy”. 

[[File:Map France 1477-fr.svg|thumb|left|France after the [[Hundred Years War]]. Red line: Boundary of the [[Kingdom of France]]; Light blue: the directly held royal domain]]
In the 4th century AD, Gaul’s eastern frontier along the [[Rhine]] was overrun by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]], principally the [[Franks]], from whom the ancient name of “Francie” was derived. The modern name “France” derives from the name of the feudal domain of the [[House of Capet|Capetian]] Kings of France around Paris. The Franks were the first tribe among the Germanic conquerors of Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert to [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Christianity rather than [[Arianism]] (their King [[Clovis I|Clovis]] did so in 498); thus France obtained the title “Eldest daughter of the Church” (''La fille aînée de l’Église''),<ref>[http://www.wf-f.org/03-1-France.html Faith of the Eldest Daughter - Can France retain her Catholic heritage?] - [http://www.wf-f.org/ Women for Faith and Family]</ref> and the French would adopt this as justification for calling themselves “the Most Christian Kingdom of France”.

Existence as a separate entity began with the [[Treaty of Verdun]] (843), with the division of [[Charlemagne]]'s [[Carolingian Empire]] into [[East Francia]], [[Middle Francia]] and [[West Francia]]. Western Francia approximated the area occupied by modern France and was the precursor to modern France.<ref>[http://history.howstuffworks.com/european-history/treaty-of-verdun.htm Treaty of Verdun] - Howstuffworks</ref>
The [[Carolingian dynasty]] ruled France until 987, when [[Hugh Capet of France|Hugh Capet]], Duke of France and Count of Paris, was crowned [[King of France]].<ref>[http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=1008&HistoryID=ab03&gtrack=pthc History of France : The Capetian kings of France: AD 987-1328] - History World</ref> 

His descendants, the [[House of Capet|Direct Capetians]], the [[House of Valois]] and the [[House of Bourbon]], progressively unified the country through a series of wars and dynastic inheritance into a [[centralised kingdom|Kingdom of France]].
The [[Albigensian Crusade]] was launched in 1209 to eliminate the heretical [[Cathars]] of [[Occitania]] (the southern area of modern-day France). In the end, both the Cathars and the independence of southern France were exterminated.<ref>{{cite news

In 1066, the [[William the Conqueror|Duke of Normandy]] added King of England to his titles. Later Kings expanded their territory to cover over half of modern continental France, including most of the North, Centre and West of France.

The exact boundaries changed greatly with time, but French landholdings of the [[List of English monarchs|English Kings]] remained extensive for centuries.

The monarchy reached its height during the 17th century and the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. At this time, France possessed the largest population in Europe (see [[Demographics of France]]) and had tremendous influence over European politics, economy, and culture. Since the 18th century, [[French language|French]] was the most used language in diplomacy, science, literature and international affairs, before English took the lead in the 20th century.<ref>[http://www.nakedtranslations.com/en/2004/language-and-diplomacy/ Language and Diplomacy] - Naked Translations</ref> Much of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] occurred in French intellectual circles, and major scientific breakthroughs were achieved by French scientists in the 18th century. In addition, France obtained many overseas possessions in the Americas, Africa and Asia.

The monarchy ruled France until the [[French Revolution]]. It did not fall immediately after the [[storming of the Bastille]] on 14 July 1789, but endured until the creation of the [[French First Republic|First Republic]] in September 1792. [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] and his wife, [[Marie Antoinette]], were executed (in 1793), along with thousands of other French citizens during the [[Reign of Terror]].

Following Napoleon's final defeat in 1815 at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], the monarchy was [[Bourbon Restoration|re-established]] (1814–1830), but with new constitutional limitations. In 1830, a [[July Revolution|civil uprising]] established the [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional]] [[July Monarchy]], which lasted until 1848. The short-lived [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] ended in 1852 when [[Napoleon III of France|Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]] proclaimed the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]]. Louis-Napoléon was unseated following defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War|Franco-Prussian war]] of 1870 and his regime was replaced by the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]].

France had [[French colonial empire|colonial possessions]], in various forms, since the beginning of the 17th century until the 1960s. In the 19th and 20th centuries, its [[global Empire|global]] overseas colonial empire was the second largest in the world behind the [[British Empire]]. At its peak, between 1919 and 1939, the second French colonial empire extended over 12,347,000 square kilometres (4,767,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of land. Including [[metropolitan France]], the total area of land under French [[sovereignty]] reached 12,898,000 square kilometres (4,980,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) in the 1920s and 1930s, which is 8.6% of the world's land area.

France is divided into 26 administrative [[Regions of France|regions]].<ref name= France/> 22 are in [[metropolitan France]] (21 are on the continental part of metropolitan France; one is the territorial collectivity of [[Corsica]]), and four are [[overseas region]]s. The regions are further subdivided into 100 [[Departments of France|departments]]<ref>[http://www.myfrenchproperty.com/departments/departments.php Departments of France] - My French Property</ref> which are numbered (mainly alphabetically). This number is used in postal codes and vehicle number plates amongst others. The 100 departments are subdivided into 341 [[Arrondissements of France|arrondissements]] which are, in turn, subdivided into 4,032 [[Cantons of France|cantons]]. These cantons are then divided into 36,680 [[Communes of France|communes]], which are municipalities with an elected municipal council. There also exist 2,588 [[Communes in France#Intercommunality|intercommunal]] entities grouping 33,414 of the 36,680 communes (i.e. 91.1% of all the communes). Three communes, Paris, Lyon and Marseille are also subdivided into 45 [[Municipal arrondissements of France|municipal arrondissements]].

The regions, departments and communes are all known as [[territorial collectivity|territorial collectivities]], meaning they possess local assemblies as well as an executive. Arrondissements and cantons are merely administrative divisions. However, this was not always the case. Until 1940, the arrondissements were also territorial collectivities with an elected assembly, but these were suspended by the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] and definitely abolished by the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] in 1946. Historically, the cantons were also territorial collectivities with their elected assemblies.

=== Overseas regions/departments, collectivities, and territories ===
{{Main|Overseas departments and territories of France}}

Among the 100 departments of France, four ([[French Guiana]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], and [[Réunion]]) are in overseas regions (ROMs) that are also simultaneously [[overseas department]]s (DOMs) and are an integral part of France (and the European Union) and thus enjoy a status similar to metropolitan departments.

In addition to the 26 regions and 100 departments, the French Republic also has six [[overseas collectivity|overseas collectivities]] ([[French Polynesia]], [[Mayotte]], [[Saint Barthélemy]], [[Saint Martin (France)|Saint Martin]], [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], and [[Wallis and Futuna]]), one ''[[sui generis]]'' collectivity ([[New Caledonia]]), one [[overseas territory (France)|overseas territory]] ([[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]]), and one island possession in the Pacific Ocean ([[Clipperton Island]]).

{{Main|Government of France|Constitution of France|Politics of France}}<!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series-->
The French Republic is a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] [[republic]] with strong [[democratic]] traditions. The [[Constitution of France|constitution]] of the Fifth Republic was approved by [[referendum]] on 28 September 1958.<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/home/0,3305,en_2649_201185_1_1_1_1_1,00.html France: Fifth Republic] - [http://flagspot.net/flags/index.html Flags of the Wolrd]</ref> It greatly strengthened the authority of the executive in relation to [[Government of France#Legislative branch|parliament]]. The executive branch itself has two leaders: the [[President of the French Republic|President of the Republic]], currently [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], who is [[head of state]] and is elected directly by universal adult suffrage for a 5-year term (formerly 7 years),<ref>{{fr}} [http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/dossiers/quinquennat/chronologie.shtml Le quinquennat : le référendum du 24 Septembre 2000]</ref> and the Government, led by the president-appointed [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]], currently [[François Fillon]].

[[File:Nicolas Sarkozy (2008).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nicolas Sarkozy]] has been the [[President of France|President of the French Republic]] since 2007]]

The French [[Parliament of France|parliament]] is a [[bicameral]] legislature comprising a [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]] (''Assemblée Nationale'') and a [[Senate of France|Senate]].<ref>[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/synthetic_files/file_4.asp The National Assembly and the Senate - General Characteristics of the Parliament] on the [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/index.asp Official Site of the French National Assembly]</ref> The National Assembly deputies represent local constituencies and are directly elected for 5-year terms.<ref>[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/election.asp#election Election of deputies] on the [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/index.asp Official Site of the National Assembly]</ref> The Assembly has the power to dismiss the cabinet, and thus the majority in the Assembly determines the choice of government. Senators are chosen by an electoral college for 6-year terms (originally 9-year terms), and one half of the seats are submitted to election every 3 years starting in September 2008.<ref>[http://www.senat.fr/lng/en/election_senateurs.html The senatorial elections] - on the [http://www.senat.fr/lng/en/index.html Official Site of the Senate]</ref>

The [[French Senate|Senate's]] legislative powers are limited; in the event of disagreement between the two chambers, the National Assembly has the final say.<ref>{{fr}} [http://www.politique.net/2007081801-le-role-du-senat.htm Le role du Sénat]</ref> The government has a strong influence in shaping the agenda of Parliament.

French politics are characterised by two politically opposed groupings: one left-wing, centred around the [[Socialist Party (France)|French Socialist Party]], and the other right-wing, centred previously around the [[Rally for the Republic|Rassemblement pour la République (RPR)]] and now its successor the [[Union for a Popular Movement|Union for a Popular Movement (UMP)]].<ref>{{fr}} {{cite book |title=La France vers le bipartisme ? : La présidentialisation du PS et de l'UMP|last=Grunberg |first=Gérard |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher= |location= |isbn=2724610105|page= |pages= |url=http://www.pressesdesciencespo.fr/fr/livre/?GCOI=27246100617740|accessdate=}}</ref> The executive branch is currently composed mostly of the UMP.

== Law ==
{{Main|Law of France}}
[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|upright|The basic principles that the French Republic must respect are found in the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]]]

France uses a [[civil law (legal system)|civil legal]] system;<ref name=France/> that is, law arises primarily from written statutes; judges are not to make law, but merely to interpret it (though the amount of judge interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to [[case law]]). Basic principles of the [[rule of law]] were laid in the [[Napoleonic Code]]. In agreement with the principles of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society. As [[Guy Canivet]], first president of the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]], wrote about the management of prisons: <!--<ref>[http://www.reseauvoltaire.net/article7985.html]</ref> -->
:''Freedom is the rule, and its restriction is the exception; any restriction of Freedom must be provided for by Law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality.''
That is, Law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed, and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy.

French law is divided into two principal areas: [[private law]] and [[public law]]. Private law includes, in particular, [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[criminal law]]. Public law includes, in particular, [[administrative law]] and [[constitutional law]]. However, in practical terms, French law comprises three principal areas of law: civil law, criminal law and administrative law.

France does not recognise [[religious law]], nor does it recognise religious beliefs or morality as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions. As a consequence, France has long had neither [[blasphemy]] laws nor [[sodomy law]]s (the latter being abolished in 1791). However, "offences against [[public decency]]" (''contraires aux bonnes mœurs'') or [[breach of the peace|disturbing public order]] (''trouble à l'ordre public'') have been used to repress public expressions of [[homosexuality]] or street [[prostitution]].

Criminal laws can only address the future and not the past (criminal ''[[ex post facto]]'' laws are prohibited) ; and to be applicable, laws must be officially published in the ''[[Journal Officiel de la République Française]]''.

Being a [[United Nations Security Council#Permanent members|permanent member of the Security Council of the UN]], and a [[List of states with nuclear weapons#Five nuclear-weapon states under the NPT|recognised nuclear state]] since 1960, spending the [[List of countries by military expenditures|third or fourth largest amount of money in military]], France has one of the most technologically advanced and powerful armies on Earth. Amongst members of the EU, only the United Kingdom has an army equal to that of France in terms of size.  

The French [[armed forces]] are divided into four branches:
* [[French Army|Armée de Terre]] (Army)
* [[French Navy|Marine Nationale]] (Navy)
* [[French Air Force|Armée de l'Air]] (Air Force)
* [[French Gendarmerie|Gendarmerie Nationale]] (A military force which acts as a National Rural Police and as a [[Military police]] for the entire French military).

After the [[Algerian War]], [[conscription]] was steadily reduced and was finally suspended in 1997 by President [[Jacques Chirac]].<ref>{{fr}} [http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/dossiers/service-civil/fin-service-militaire-obligatoire.shtml La fin du service militaire obligatoire] - La documentation française</ref> The total number of military personnel is approximately 347,000.<ref>{{fr}} [http://wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http://www.defense.gouv.fr/defense/le_ministere/organisation_et_missions/organisation/effectifs/militaires/personnel_militaire&title=Personnel%20militaire Personnel militaire] - [http://www.defense.gouv.fr/portail-defense Ministère de la Défense]</ref> France spends in 2010 2.5% of its [[GDP]] on defence,<ref>{{fr}} {{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gouv.fr/defense/content/download/162068/1397838/file/PLF-MINDEF-2010-10POINTS.pdf|title=Budget de la Défense - Les 10 principales mesures et chiffres clés pour 2010|auteur=Ministère de la Défense|site=defense.gouv.fr|consulté le=3 mars 2010}}</ref> slightly more than the United Kingdom (2.3%)<ref name = NATO>[http://www.nato.int/docu/pr/2005/p05-161.pdf NATO-Russia compendium of financial and economic data relating to defence] - NATO</ref> and the highest in the European Union where defence spending generally accounts to less than 1.5% of GDP.<ref name= NATO/> Thus, France has the [[List of countries by military expenditures|third or fourth largest military budget in the world]].

France has major military industries that have produced the [[Rafale]] fighter, the [[Charles de Gaulle (R 91)|Charles de Gaulle]] aircraft carrier, the [[Exocet]] missile and the [[Leclerc]] tank amongst others. Some weaponry, like the [[E-2 Hawkeye]] or the [[E-3 Sentry]] was bought from the United States. Despite withdrawing from the [[Eurofighter]] project, France is actively investing in European joint projects such as the [[Eurocopter Tiger]], [[FREMM multipurpose frigate|multipurpose frigates]], the [[UCAV]] demonstrator [[nEUROn]] and the [[Airbus A400M]]. France has the most powerful [[aerospace industry]] in Europe.<ref>[http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1990/7/90.07.06.x.html The aerospace industry : XII.

France is a major arms seller,<ref>"En 2001, la France a vendu pour 1,288 milliard de dollars d'équipements militaires, ce qui la met au troisième rang mondial des exportateurs derrière les Etats-Unis et la Russie." " In 2001, France sold for $1,288 billion of military equipments, ranking 3rd in the world for arms exportations behind the USA and Russia" [http://www.lexpansion.com/economie/actualite-entreprise/la-france-demeure-un-fournisseur-d-armes-de-premier-plan_95084.html France stays one of the biggest arms supplier] - L'express</ref><ref>"La France est au 4ème rang mondial des exportateurs d'armes, derrière les Etats-Unis, le Royaume-Uni et la Russie, et devant Israël, selon un rapport du ministère de la Défense publié l'an dernier."

Some of the French designed equipments are specifically designed for exports like the Franco-Spanish [[Scorpène class submarine|''Scorpène'' class submarine]]s. Some French equipments have been largely modified to fit allied countries' requirements like the [[Formidable class frigate|''Formidable'' class frigate]]s (based on the ''La Fayette'' class) or the [[Agosta 90B class submarine|''Hashmat'' class submarines]] (based on the ''Agosta'' class submarines).

* Although it includes very competent anti-terrorist units such as the [[GIGN]] or the [[Escadron Parachutiste d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale|EPIGN]], the gendarmerie is a military police force which serves for the most part as a rural and general purpose police force. Since its creation the GIGN has taken part in roughly one thousand operations and freed over five-hundred hostages; the [[Air France Flight 8969]]'s hijacking brought them to the world's attention with a very successful antiterrorist operation.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,163487,00.html Anatomy of a Hijack] - Time</ref>
* French intelligence consists of two major units: the [[Direction générale de la sécurité extérieure|DGSE]] (the external agency) and the [[Direction centrale du renseignement intérieur|DCRI]] (domestic agency). The latter being part of the police while the former is associated to the army. The DGSE is notorious for the [[Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|Sinking of the ''Rainbow Warrior'']], but it is also known for revealing the most extensive technological spy network uncovered in Europe and the United States to date through the [[mole (espionage)|mole]] [[Vladimir Vetrov]].
[[File:Rafale-ec-1-7.jpg|thumb|left|A pair of [[Rafale]] [[fighter aircraft]]]]
* The French deterrence, (formerly known as “''[[Force de frappe]]''”), relies on a complete independence. The current French nuclear force consists of four submarines equipped with [[M45 SLBM|M45]] ballistic missiles. The current [[Le Triomphant class submarine|''Triomphant'']] class is currently under deployment to replace the former [[Le Redoutable class submarine|''Redoutable'']] class. The [[M51 SLBM|M51]] will replace the M45 in the future and expand the ''Triomphant''s firing range. Aside of the submarines the French dissuasion force uses the [[Dassault Mirage 2000N/2000D|Mirage 2000N]]; it is a variant of the Mirage 2000 and thus is designed to deliver nuclear strikes. Other nuclear devices like the Plateau d'Albion's [[Intermediate-range ballistic missile]] and the short range [[Hadès (missile)|Hadès]] missiles have been disarmed. With 350 nuclear heads stockpiled France is the world's third largest nuclear power.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/summary.htm Comparison of recognised and alleged nuclear powers].</ref>
* The [[Marine Nationale]] is regarded as one of the world's most powerful navies. The professional compendium ''flottes de combats'', in its 2006 edition, ranked it world's 6th biggest navy after the American, Russian, Chinese, British and Japanese navies.<ref>{{fr}} {{cite web|url=http://www.meretmarine.com/article.cfm?id=958|title=La marine chinoise accède au rang de 3ème puissance mondiale}}</ref>

Recently [[Mistral class landing platform dock|''Mistral'']] class ships joined the Marine Nationale, the Mistral itself having taken part to operations in Lebanon. For the 2004 centennial of the [[Entente Cordiale]] President Chirac announced the [[Future French aircraft carrier]] would be jointly designed with Great Britain. The French navy is equipped with the [[La Fayette class frigate|''La Fayette'' class frigate]]s, early examples of stealth ships, and several ships are expected to be retired in the next few years and replaced by more modern ships, examples of future surface ships are the [[Horizon class frigate|Forbin]] and the [[FREMM multipurpose frigate|''Aquitaine'']] class frigates. The attack submarines are also part of the [[Force Océanique Stratégique]] although they do not carry the nuclear dissuasion, the current class is the [[Rubis class submarine|''Rubis'' Class]] and will be replaced in the future by the expected [[French Barracuda class submarine|''Suffren'' Class]].

* The ''[[French Army|Armée de Terre]]'' employs as of 2009 123,100 people.<ref>{{fr}} [http://www.defense.gouv.fr/terre/presentation/directions-commandements-et-centres/ressources-humaines/direction-des-ressources-humaines-de-l-armee-de-terre Direction des ressources humaines de l'armée de Terre] - [http://www.defense.gouv.fr/ Ministère de la Défense]</ref> It is famous for the ''[[French Foreign Legion|Légion Etrangère]]'' (French Foreign Legion) though the French special forces are not the Legion but the [[13th Parachute Dragoon Regiment|Dragons Parachutistes]] and the [[1st Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment|Marines Parachutistes]]. The French assault rifle is the [[FAMAS (rifle)|FAMAS]] and future infantry combat system is the [[Félin]]. France uses both tracked and wheeled vehicles to a significant points, examples of wheeled vehicles would be the [[Camion équipé d'un système d'artillerie|Caesar]] or the [[AMX 10 RC]]. Although its main battle tank is the [[Leclerc]] many older [[AMX 30]] tanks are still operational. It uses the [[AMX 30 AuF1]] for artillery and is equipped with [[Eurocopter Tiger]]s helicopters.
* The [[French Air Force|Armée de l'Air]] is the oldest and first professional air force worldwide.<ref>[http://www.military-aircraft.org/france/french-military-aircraft.php French Military Aircraft] - Military Aircraft</ref> It still today retains a significant capacity. It uses mainly two aircraft fighters: the older [[Dassault Mirage F1|Mirage F1]] and the more recent [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]]. The later model exists in a ground attack version called the [[Dassault Mirage 2000N/2000D|Mirage2000D]]. The modern [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] is in deployment in both the French air force and navy.

[[Christianity]] is the largest religion in France, which is a [[secular]] country, and freedom of religion is a constitutional right. The French government does not keep [[statistics]] on religious adherence, nor on ethnicity or on political affiliation.  However, some unofficial survey estimates exist:

* A poll published early 2010, presented following figures.  Whilst, in 1965, 81% of the French declared themselves as Catholics, they were no more than 64% in 2009, the reduction in active Catholics was even more profound whilst 27% of the French went to Mass once a week or more in 1952, there are no more than 4.5% in 2006.<ref name=catho>{{fr}} [http://www.la-croix.com/La-France-reste-catholique-mais-moins-pratiquante/article/2407513/4078 La France reste catholique mais moins pratiquante] - La Croix</ref>  Besides 64 % Catholics, there were 3 % Protestants, 5 % other religions and 28 % without religion.<ref name=catho/>

One other study shows 32% of people in France declaring themselves to be [[atheists]], and another 32% declaring themselves “sceptical about the existence of God but not an atheist”.<ref>[http://www.harrisinteractive.com/news/allnewsbydate.asp?NewsID=1131 Religious Views and Beliefs Vary Greatly by Country], Financial Times/Harris Poll, December 2006</ref>

Estimates of the number of [[Islam in France|Muslims in France]] vary widely. According to the more than one decade old 1999 French census returns, there were 3.7 million people of “possible Muslim faith” in France (6.3% of the total population). In 2003, the French Ministry of the Interior estimated the total number of Muslims to be between five and six million (8–10%).<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/apr/23/france.islam France to train imams in 'French Islam'], The Guardian</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51552.htm|title=France – International Religious Freedom Report 2005}}</ref> The current [[Jews in France|Jewish community in France]] numbers around 600,000 according to the [[World Jewish Congress]] and is the largest in Europe.

Since 1905 the French government has followed the principle of ''[[laïcité]]'', in which it is prohibited from recognizing any ''religion'' (except for legacy statutes like that of military [[chaplain]]s and the [[Local law in Alsace-Moselle|local law]] in [[Alsace-Moselle]]). Instead, it merely recognizes ''religious organizations'', according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine. Conversely, religious organizations should refrain from intervening in policy-making.

Certain body of beliefs such as [[Scientology]], [[Children of God (New Religious Movement)|Children of God]], the [[Unification Church]], or the [[Order of the Solar Temple]] are considered [[cult]]s ("''[[sect#Corresponding words in other European languages|sectes]]''" in French),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/rap-enq/r2468.asp|title=Commission d’enquête sur les sectes}}</ref> and therefore do not have the same status as religions in France.

=== Education ===
[[File:EducationFr.svg|thumb|350px|School system in France]]
{{main|Education in France}}

{{see also|History of education in France|Baccalauréat}}

In 1802, [[Napoléon Bonaparte]] created the [[lycée]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/352505/lycee Lycée] - Encyclopeadia Britannica</ref> Nevertheless it is [[Jules Ferry]] who is considered to be the father of the French modern school, which is free, [[secular]], and compulsory until the age of 13 since 1882<ref>{{fr}} [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/site-jeunes/laicite/fiche-dates/fiche-1881-1882/fiche.pdf 1881-1882 : Lois Ferry Ecole publique gratuite, laïque et obligatoire] - Assemblé Nationale</ref> (school attendace in France is now compulsory until the age of 16<ref>{{fr}} [http://www.senat.fr/rap/l97-504/l97-5041.html II.

Nowadays, the schooling system in France is centralized, and is composed of three stages, primary education, secondary education, and higher education.  The [[Programme for International Student Assessment]], coordinated by the [[OECD]], currently ranks France's education as the 25th best in the world, being neither significantly higher nor lower than the OECD average.<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/8/39700724.pdf Range of rank on the PISA 2006 science scale] - OECD</ref> Primary and secondary education are predominantly public, run by the [[Minister of National Education (France)|Ministry of National Education]].

=== Media ===
Compared to other developed countries, French do not spend much time reading newspapers, due to the popularity of broadcast media. Best-selling daily national newspapers in France are ''[[Le Monde]]''  and right-wing ''[[Le Figaro]]'', with around 300.000 copies sold daily, but also ''[[L'Équipe]]'', dedicated to sports coverage.<ref>{{fr}} OJD, "Observatoire de la Presse", [http://observatoire.ojd.com/report/visu/obs/20/do/GP_PQN/ Presse Quotidienne Nationale]</ref> In the past years, free dailies made a breakthrough, with ''[[Metro International|Metro]]'', ''[[20 minutes (France)|20 Minutes]]'' and ''[[Direct Plus]]'' distributed at more than 650.000 copies respectively.<ref>{{fr}} OJD, [http://www.ojd.com/pgi/section/ Presse Gratuite d'Information]</ref> However, the widest circulations are reached by regional daily ''[[Ouest France]]'' with more than 750.000 copies sold, and the 50 other regional papers have also high sales.<ref>{{fr}} Observatoire de la Presse, [http://observatoire.ojd.com/report/visu/obs/20/do/GP_PQRD/ Presse Quotidienne Régionale et Départementale]</ref><ref>{{fr}} OJD, "Bureau Presse Payante Grand Public", [http://www.ojd.com/chiffres/section/PPGP/print?submitted=1&section=PPGP&famille=2&thema=&search=&go=Lancer+la+recherche Presse Quotidienne Régionale et Départementale]</ref> The sector of weekly magazines is stronger and diversified with more than 400 specialized weekly magazines published in the country.<ref>{{fr}} Observatoire de la Presse, [http://observatoire.ojd.com/report/visu/obs/20/do/GP_PMAG/ Presse Magazine - Synthèse]</ref> 

The most influential news magazine are left-wing ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'', centrist ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'' and right-wing ''[[Le Point]]'' (more than 400.000 copies),<ref>{{fr}} Observatoire de la Presse, [http://observatoire.ojd.com/report/visu/obs/20/do/GP_NEWS/ Presse News]</ref> but the highest circulation for weeklies is reached by TV magazines and by women’s magazines, among them ''[[Marie Claire]]'' and ''[[ELLE]]'', which have foreign versions. Influential weeklies also include investigative and satirical papers ''[[Le Canard Enchaîné]]'' and ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'', as well as ''[[Paris Match]]''. Like in most industrialized nations, the print media have been affected by a [[Newspaper crisis|severe crisis]] in the past decade. In 2008, the government have launched a major initiative to help the sector reform to be financially independent,<ref>''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/3125110/Nicolas-Sarkozy-French-media-faces-death-without-reform.html Nicolas Sarkozy: French media faces 'death' without reform] 02 October 2008</ref><ref>French government portal, [http://www.gouvernement.fr/gouvernement/lancement-des-etats-generaux-de-la-presse Lancement des états généraux de la presse] 02 October 2008 [Launching of General State of written media]</ref> but in 2009 it had to give 600.000 euros to help the print media cope with the [[Global financial crisis of 2008-2009|economic crisis]], in addition to existing subsidies.<ref>[[Angelique Chrisafis]], ''[[The Guardian]]'', [http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/jan/23/sarkozy-pledges-state-aid-to-newspapers Sarkozy pledges €600m to newspapers], 23 January 2009.</ref>

In 1974, after years of centralized monopoly on radio and television, the governmental agency [[ORTF]] was split into several national institutions, but the three already-existing TV channels and four national radio stations<ref>Radio France, "L'entreprise", [http://www.radiofrance.fr/lentreprise/reperes/statuts/ Repères] [Landmarks of Radio France company]</ref><ref name=mediapol>{{fr}} Vie Publique, [http://www.vie-publique.fr/politiques-publiques/politique-audiovisuel/chronologie/ Chronologie de la politique de l’audiovisuel] 20/08/2004 [Chronology of policy for audiovisual]</ref> remained under state-control. It was only in 1981 when the government allowed free broadcasting in the territory, ending state monopoly on radio.<ref name=mediapol/> French television was partly liberalized in the next two decade with the creation of several commercial channels, mainly thanks to cable and satellite television. In 2005 the national service [[Télévision Numérique Terrestre]] introduced digital television all over the territory, allowing the creation of other channels. 

The four existing national channels are now owned by state-owned consortium [[France Télévisions]], while public broadcasting group [[Radio France]] run five national radio stations. Among these public media are [[Radio France Internationale]], which broadcasts programs in French all over the world, and franco-german TV channel [[TV5 Monde]]. In 2006, the government created global news channel [[France 24]]. Long-established TV channels [[TF1]] (privatized in 1987), [[France 2]] and [[France 3]] have the highest shares, while  radio stations [[RTL (French radio)|RTL]], [[Europe 1]] and state-owned [[France Inter]] are the lost listened to.

Then this figure gradually became the most widely shared representation of the French, used by French monarchs, then by the Revolution and under the successive republican regimes as representation of the national identity, used for some stamps and coins.<ref>{{fr}} French Presidency, "Les symboles de la République française", [http://www.elysee.fr/president/la-presidence/les-symboles-de-la-republique-francaise/le-coq/le-coq.6052.html Le coq]</ref> Although it is not an official symbol of the Republic, it is the most common image to symbolize France in the collective imagination and abroad.

=== Conventions and notations ===
* France is the home of the [[International System of Units]] (the metric system).<ref>[http://www.nist.gov/physlab/div842/fcdc/si-units.cfm International System of Units (SI)] - Physics Laboratory</ref> Some pre-metric units are still used, essentially the ''[[Pound (mass)#French livre|livre]]'' (a unit of weight equal to half a kilogram) and the ''[[quintal]]'' (a unit of weight equal to 100 kilograms).
* In [[mathematics]], France uses the [[infix notation]] like most countries. For large numbers the [[long and short scales|long scale]] is used. Thus, the French use the word ''[[billion (word)|billion]]'' for the number 1,000,000,000,000, which in countries using [[Long and short scales|short scale]] is called a [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]]. However, there exists a French word, ''milliard'', for the number 1,000,000,000, which in countries using the short scale is called a billion. Thus, despite the use of the long scale, one billion is called ''un milliard'' ("one milliard") in French, and not ''mille millions'' ("one thousand million"). It should also be noted that names of numbers above the ''milliard'' are rarely used. Thus, one trillion will most often be called ''mille milliards'' (“one thousand milliard”) in French, and rarely ''un billion''.
* In the French numeral notation, the comma (,) is the [[decimal separator]], whereas a space is used between each group of three digits (fifteen million five hundred thousand and thirty-two should be written as 15 500 032). In finance, the currency symbol is used as a decimal separator or put after the number. For example, €25,048.05 is written either 25 048€05 or 25 048,05 € (always with an extra space between the figure and the currency symbol).
* In computing, a [[bit]] is called a bit yet a [[byte]] is called an [[octet (computing)|octet]]<ref>[http://dictionary.reverso.net/french-english/octet English translation of "Octet"] on [http://dictionary.reverso.net/ Reverso]</ref> (from the Latin root ''octo'', meaning "8"). [[SI prefix]]es are used.
* [[24-hour clock]] time is used, with h being the separator between hours and minutes (for example 2:30 p.m. is 14h30).
* The all-numeric form for dates is in the order day-month-year, using a slash as the separator (example: 31/12/1992 or 31/12/92).

== Culture and arts ==
{{Main|Culture of France}}
France has been a center of cultural creation for centuries. Many French artists have been among the most renowned of their time, and France is still much recognized and admired in the world for its very rich cultural tradition.

The successive political regimes have always promoted artistic creation, and the creation of the [[Minister of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]] in 1959 helped preserve the cultural heritage of the country and make it available to public. The Ministry of Culture has been very active since its creation, granting subsidies to artists, promoting French culture in the world, supporting festivals and cultural events, protecting [[Monument historique|historical monuments]]. The French government also succeeded in maintaining a [[cultural exception]] to defend audiovisual products made in the country.

France is the country that receive the highest number of tourists per year, largely thanks to the numerous cultural establishments and historical buildings implanted all over the territory. It counts 1,200 [[List of museums in France|museums]] welcoming more than 50 million people annually.<ref>Ministère de la Culture et de la Communication, "Cultura statistics", [http://www2.culture.gouv.fr/culture/deps/2008/pdf/minichiffrescles2010-en.pdf Key figures]</ref> The most important cultural sites are run by the government, for instance through the public agency [[Centre des monuments nationaux]], which have around hundred [[Monument historique|national historical monuments]] at charge. The 43,180 buildings protected as historical monuments include mainly residences (many [[List of castles in France|castles]], or ''[[château]]x'' in French) and religious buildings ([[List of cathedrals in France|cathedrals]], [[List of basilicas in France|basilicas]], churches, etc), but also statutes, memorials and [[Gardens of France|gardens]].

=== Painting ===
{{Main|French painting}}
[[File:Claude Monet 1899 Nadar.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Claude Monet]], founder of the [[Impressionist]] movement]]
The origins of [[French painting]] were very much influenced by [[Italian art]]. The two most famous French artists of the time of [[Renaissance]], [[Nicolas Poussin]] and [[Claude Lorrain]], lived in Italy. Louis XIV's prime minister [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] founded in 1648 the [[Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture]] to protect these artists, and in 1666 he created the still-in-activity [[French Academy in Rome]] to have direct relations with Italian artists. French painting also followed the evolution of Italian painters towards a rococo style in the eighteenth century, as an imitation of old baroque style, the works of court-endorsed artists [[Antoine Watteau]], [[François Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]] being the most representative in the country. The French Revolution brought great changes, as [[Napoleon I]] favoured painters of [[neoclassicism|neoclassic style]] as [[Jacques-Louis David]]. The middle of the eighteen century was dominated by two successive movements, at first [[Romanticism]] with [[Théodore Géricault]] and [[Eugène Delacroix]], a more realistic painting with [[Camille Corot]], [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Jean-François Millet]].

In the second part of the eighteenth century, France became a center of artistic creation, developing a new style of painting and counting on the most famous impressionist painters of the period, among them [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Auguste Renoir]].<ref>The National Gallery of London official website, [http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/learn-about-art/guide-to-impressionism/guide-to-impressionism Guide to Impressionism]</ref> Second generation of impressionist-style painters [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Georges Seurat]] were also at the avant-guarde of artistic evolutions,<ref>{{fr}} RFI, [http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/063/article_34792.asp Le néo-impressionnisme de Seurat à Paul Klee] 15/03/2005</ref> as well as [[fauvism|fauvist artists]] [[Henri Matisse]], [[André Derain]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]].<ref>National Gallery of Art (United States), [http://www.nga.gov/feature/artnation/fauve/index.shtm The Fauves (dossier)]</ref><ref>{{fr}} RFI, [http://www.rfi.fr/culturefr/articles/098/article_63189.asp Vlaminck, version fauve], 25/02/2008</ref> At the beginning of twentieth century, Cubism was developed by [[Georges Braque]] and Spanish painter [[Pablo Picasso]], living in Paris. Other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near Paris, like [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Marc Chagall]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]].

Many museums in France are entirely or partly devoted to painting works. A huge collection of old masterpieces created before or during the eighteenth century are exposed in the state-owned [[Musée du Louvre]], such as [[Mona Lisa]], also known as [[La Joconde]]. While the [[Louvre Palace]] has been for a long time a museum, the [[Musée d'Orsay]] was inaugurated in 1986 in the old railway station [[Gare d'Orsay]], in a major reorganization of national art collections, to gather French paintings from the second part of the nineteenth century (mainly Impressionism and Fauvism movements).<ref>Musée d'Orsay (official website), History of the museum - [http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/history-of-the-museum/home.html From station to museum]</ref><ref>Musée d'Orsay official website, [http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/history-of-the-collections/painting.html History of the painting collection]</ref> Modern works are presented in the [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]], which moved in 1976 to the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]].

=== Architecture ===
{{Main|French architecture}}
Technically speaking, there is no standard type of "French" architecture, although that has not always been true. [[Gothic Architecture]]'s old name was ''French Architecture'' (or Opus Francigenum).<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/opus-francigenum-art Opus Francigenum] - Answers.com</ref> The term “Gothic” appeared later as a stylistic insult and was widely adopted. The Gothic Architecture was the first French style of Architecture to be copied in all Europe.<ref>[http://www.justfrance.org/france/architecture/001.asp The Gothic period] - France Travel</ref> Northern France is the home of some of the most important Gothic [[cathedrals]] and [[basilicas]], the first of these being the [[Saint Denis Basilica]] (used as the royal necropolis); other important French Gothic cathedrals are [[Cathedral of Chartres|Notre-Dame de Chartres]] and [[Amiens Cathedral|Notre-Dame d'Amiens]]. The kings were crowned in another important Gothic church: [[Notre-Dame de Reims]].<ref>{{fr}} [http://www.cathedrale-reims.culture.fr/histoire.html Histoire et Architecture] - [http://www.cathedrale-reims.culture.fr/ Site officiel de la Cathedrale de Notre-Dame de Reims]</ref> Aside from churches, Gothic Architecture had been used for many religious palaces, the most important one being the [[Palais des Papes]] in Avignon.
[[File:Sainte chapelle - Upper level.jpg|thumb|left|[[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis']] [[Sainte Chapelle]] represents the French impact on religious architecture.]]
During the Middle Ages, fortified [[castle]]s were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers against their rivals. When [[Philip II of France|King Philip II]] took [[Rouen]] from [[John of England|King John]], for example, he demolished the ducal castle to build a bigger one. Fortified cities were also common, unfortunately most French castles did not survive the passage of time. This is why [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart's]] [[Château Gaillard]] was demolished, as well as the [[Château de Lusignan]]. Some important French castles that survived are [[Chinon (castle)|Chinon]], [[Château d'Angers]], the massive [[Château de Vincennes]] and the so called [[Cathar castles]].

Before the appearance of this architecture France had been using [[Romanesque architecture]] like most of Western Europe (with the exception of the Iberian Peninsula, which used Mooresque architecture, which now consists of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]). Some of the greatest examples of Romanesque churches in France are the [[Basilique de Saint-Sernin, Toulouse|Saint Sernin Basilica]] in [[Toulouse, France|Toulouse]] (largest romanesque church in Europe<ref>[http://www.europeupclose.com/france/southwest-france/toulouses-saint-sernin-largest-romanesque-church-in-europe/ Toulouse’s Saint Sernin, Largest Romanesque Church in Europe] - EuropeUpClose</ref>) and the remains of the [[Cluny Abbey|Cluniac Abbey]] (largely destroyed during the Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars).
[[File:Le grand foyer-2.jpg|thumb|[[Opéra Garnier]], Paris, a symbol of the French [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neo-Baroque]] style]]
The end of the Hundred Years' War marked an important stage in the evolution of French architecture. It was the time of the [[French Renaissance]] and several artists from [[Italy]] and [[Spain]] were invited to the French court; many residential palaces, inspired by the Italians, were built, but mainly in the [[Loire Valley]]. Such residential castles were the [[Château de Chambord]], the [[Château de Chenonceau]], or the [[Château d'Amboise]]. Following the renaissance and the end of the Middle Ages, [[Baroque Architecture]] replaced the traditional gothic style. However, in France, baroque architecture found a greater success in the secular domain than in a religious one.<ref>{{fr}} Claude Lébedel – Les Splendeurs du Baroque en France: ''Histoire et splendeurs du baroque en France'' page 9: “Si en allant plus loin, on prononce les mots ‘art baroque en France’, on provoque alors le plus souvent une moue interrogative, parfois seulement étonnée, parfois franchement réprobatrice: Mais voyons, l'art baroque n'existe pas en France!”</ref> In the secular domain the [[Palace of Versailles]] has many [[baroque era|baroque]] features. [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]] was said to be the most influential French architect of the baroque era, with his famous dome, [[Les Invalides]]. Some of the most impressive provincial baroque architecture is found in places that were not yet French such as the [[Place Stanislas]] in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]]. On the military architectural side, [[Vauban]] designed some of the most efficient fortresses in Europe and became an influential military architect; as a result, imitations of his works can been found all over Europe, the [[Americas]], [[Russia]] and [[Turkey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1283 |title=Fortifications of Vauban |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date=2008-07-08 |accessdate=2010-08-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/ |title=Official site of the UNESCO |publisher=Unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-09}}</ref>

[[File:Eiffel-tower-2008.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Eiffel Tower]] is an icon of both Paris and France]]
After the Revolution the [[Republicanism|Republicans]] favoured [[Neoclassicism]] although neoclassicism was introduced in France prior to the revolution with such building as the [[Panthéon, Paris|Parisian Pantheon]] or the [[Capitole de Toulouse]]. Built during the French Empire the [[Arc de Triomphe]] and [[Église de la Madeleine|Sainte Marie-Madeleine]] represent this trend the best.<ref>{{cite book |title= Paris: City Guide |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2008 |publisher= Lonely Planet |location= |isbn=1740598504|page= 48 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/?id=OtabdzMdbboC&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=arc+de+triomphe+neoclassicism+sainte+marie+madeleine&q|accessdate=}}</ref>

Under [[Napoleon III]] a new wave of [[urbanism]] and architecture was given birth. If extravagant buildings such as the [[neo-baroque]] [[Palais Garnier]] were built, the urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} For example, [[Baron Haussmann]] [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|rebuilt Paris]]. The architecture associated to this era is named [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] in English, the term being taken from the [[Second French Empire]]. At this time there was a strong Gothic resurgence across Europe and in France the associated architect was [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]]. In the late 19th century [[Gustave Eiffel]] designed many bridges, such as [[Garabit viaduct]], and remains one of the most influential bridge designer of his time, although he is best remembered for the iconic [[Eiffel Tower]].

In the 20th century, [[Swiss]] Architect [[Le Corbusier]] designed several buildings in France. More recently French architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles. The [[Louvre Pyramid]] is an example of modern architecture added to an older building. Certainly the most difficult buildings to integrate within French cities are skyscrapers, as they are visible from afar. For instance, in [[Paris]], since 1977, new buildings must have been under 37 meters, or 121 feet.<ref>[http://lci.tf1.fr/posez-vos-questions/2008-07/gratte-ciel-paris-pensez-vous-4872555.html Des gratte-ciel à Paris : qu'en pensez-vous ?] - [[La Chaîne Info|LCI]]</ref> France's largest financial district is [[La Defense]], where a significant number of skyscrapers are located.<ref>[http://www.groupenci.com/uk/ile-de-france/defense.com-square.html In the heart of the main European Business area] - NCI Buisness Center</ref> Other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges; a good example of the way this has been done is the [[Millau Viaduct]]. Some famous modern French architects include [[Jean Nouvel]] or [[Paul Andreu]].

=== Literature ===
{{Main|French literature}}

[[File:Bonnat Hugo001z.jpg|thumb|left|190px|[[Victor Hugo]] is one of the most important French novelists and poets, and is sometimes seen as the greatest French writer of all times<ref>{{fr}} {{PDF|[http://www.lecavalierbleu.com/images/30/extrait_75.pdf « Victor Hugo est le plus grand écrivain français » ]|19.0&nbsp;KB}} </ref>]]
The earliest French literature dates from the [[Middle Age]]s, when what is now known as modern France did not have a single, uniform language. There were several languages and dialects and each writer used his own spelling and grammar.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The authors of French mediaeval texts are unknown, such as [[Tristan and Iseult]] and [[Lancelot and the Holy Grail]]. Much mediaeval French poetry and literature were inspired by the legends of the [[Matter of France]], such as [[The Song of Roland]] and the various [[Chansons de geste]]. The “Roman de Renart”, written in 1175 by [[Perrout de Saint Cloude]] tells the story of the mediaeval character [[Reynard]] ('the Fox') and is another example of early French writing. The names of some authors from this period are known, for example [[Chrétien de Troyes]] and [[William IX of Aquitaine|Duke William IX of Aquitaine]], who wrote in [[Occitan]].

An important 16th century writer was [[François Rabelais]] who influenced modern French vocabulary and metaphor.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} During the 17th century, plays by [[Pierre Corneille]], [[Jean Racine]] and [[Molière]], as well as the moral and philosophical books by [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[René Descartes]], deeply influenced the French aristocracy leaving an important new niche for authors of the following decades, such as [[Jean de La Fontaine]], who was an important poet from this century.
[[File:Charles Baudelaire2.jpg|thumb|upright|19th century poet, writer, and translator [[Charles Baudelaire]].]]
French literature and poetry flourished in the 18th and 19th centuries. The 18th century saw the works of writers, essayists and moralists such as [[Voltaire]], [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].
[[Charles Perrault]] was a prolific writer of famous children's fairy tales including “[[Puss in Boots]]”, “[[Cinderella]]”, “[[Sleeping Beauty]]” and “[[Bluebeard]]”.

At the turn of the 19th century [[symbolist poetry]] was an important movement in French literature, with poets such as [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Paul Verlaine]] and [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].{{Clarify|date=July 2010}}<ref>{{fr}} [http://users.skynet.be/litterature/symbolisme/symbolismefrancais.htm Le symbolisme français]</ref> The 19th century saw the writings of French authors: [[Victor Hugo]] (''[[Les Misérables]]''), [[Alexandre Dumas]] (''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' and ''[[The Count of Monte-Cristo]]''), and [[Jules Verne]] (''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]''), which are amongst the most well-known in France and the world. Other 19th century fiction writers include [[Émile Zola]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[Guy de Maupassant]], [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Stendhal]].

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of France}}
Although the musical creation in France dates back to the Middle Ages, it knew its golden age in the seventeenth century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed several musicians and composers in the royal court. The most renowned composers of this period include [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]], [[François Couperin]], [[Michel-Richard Delalande]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] and [[Marin Marais]], all of them composers at the court. After the death of the "Roi Soleil", French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] reached some prestige, and today he is still one of the most renowned French composers. French classical music knew a revival in the nineteenth and twentieth century, at the end of the romantic movement, at first with opera composers [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Georges Bizet]], [[Gabriel Fauré]], [[Charles Gounod]], [[Jacques Offenbach]], [[Édouard Lalo]], [[Jules Massenet]] and [[Camille Saint-Saëns]]. This period was a golden age for operas, being popular in the country the [[opéra bouffon]], the [[opera-ballet]] and the [[opéra comique]] genres. Later came precursors of modern classical music [[Érik Satie]], [[Francis Poulenc]], and above all [[Maurice Ravel]] and [[Claude Debussy]], who invented new musical forms.<ref>NPR (website), [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4957580 Debussy's 'La Mer' Marks 100th Birthday], October 14, 2005</ref><ref>NPR (website), [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92338564 Debussy's Musical Game of Deception], July 12, 2008</ref><ref>Classic fM website, [http://www.classicfm.co.uk/music/composers/c-g/claude-debussy/ Biography of Claude Debussy]</ref><ref>Classic fM website, [http://www.classicfm.co.uk/music/composers/n-r/maurice-ravel/ Biography of Maurice Ravel]</ref> More recently, at the middle of the twentieth century, [[Maurice Ohana]], [[Pierre Schaeffer]] and [[Pierre Boulez]] contributed to the evolutions of [[contemporary classical music]].<ref>NPR (website), [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126668117 Composer-Conductor Pierre Boulez At 85], 24 May 2010</ref>

French music then followed the rapid emergence of pop and rock music at the middle of the twentieth century. Although English-speaking creations has reached some popularity in the country, [[French popular music|French pop music]], known as ''[[chanson française]]'', has remained very popular. Among the most important French artists of the century are [[Edith Piaf]], [[Georges Brassens]], [[Léo Ferré]], [[Charles Aznavour]] and [[Serge Gainsbourg]]. Although there are very few rock bands in France compared to English-speaking countries,<ref>[[Radio France Internationale|RFI Musique]], [http://www.rfimusique.com/siteen/biographie/biographie_6049.asp Biography of Noir Désir], March 2009 : “Rock music doesn't come naturally to the French.

Rock music has other, more Anglo-Saxon ingredients”</ref> bands such as [[Noir Désir]], [[Mano Negra]], [[Niagara (band)|Niagara]], [[Rita Mitsouko]] and more recently [[Superbus (band)|Superbus]], [[Phoenix (band)|Phoenix]] and [[Gojira]]<ref name=frmusic>France Diplomatie, [http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/france_159/culture-and-media_6819/culture_6874/music_5335/french-music-has-the-whole-planet-singing_13031.html French music has the whole planet singing], June 2009</ref> have reached worldwide popularity. Others French artists with international careers have been popular in several countries, for example female singers [[Mireille Mathieu]] and [[Mylène Farmer]],<ref name=frmusic/> electronic music pioneers [[Jean-Michel Jarre]], [[Laurent Garnier]] and [[Bob Sinclar]], and later [[David Guetta]]. In the 1990s and 2000s, electronic duos [[Daft Punk]], [[Justice (French band)|Justice]] and [[Air (band)|Air]] also reached worldwide popularity and contributed to the reputation of modern electronic music in the world.<ref name=frmusic/><ref>The Telegraph, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3669339/Daft-Punk-Behind-the-robot-masks.html Daft Punk: Behind the robot masks], 17 November 2007 : "Daft Punk were in many ways responsible for turning the spotlight on a new, cool underground of French music in the late 1990s, including bestselling acts such as Air, and have been a huge influence on the current generation of international star DJs"</ref><ref>[[BBC News]], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1721450.stm The return of French pop music], 20 December 2001</ref>

Among current musical events and institutions in France, many are dedicated to classical music and operas. The most prestigious institutions are the state-owned [[Paris National Opera]] (with its two sites [[Palais Garnier]] and [[Opéra Bastille]]), the [[Opéra National de Lyon]], the [[Théâtre du Châtelet]] in Paris, the [[Théâtre du Capitole]] in [[Toulouse]] and the [[Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux]]. As for music festivals, there are several events organized, the most popular being the [[Eurockéennes]] and [[Rock en Seine]]. The [[Fête de la Musique]], imitated by many foreign cities, was first launched by the French government in 1982.<ref>Ministry of Culture of France, [http://www.fetedelamusique.culture.fr/site-2010/?page_id=550 About « Fête de la Musique »]</ref><ref>France Diplomatie, [http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/france_159/culture-and-media_6819/culture_6874/music_5335/fete-musique-21.06.07_9392.html Fête de la Musique], June 21, 2007</ref> Major music halls and venues in France include [[Le Zénith]] sites present in many cities and other places in Paris ([[Paris Olympia]], [[Théâtre Mogador]], [[Élysée Montmartre]], etc.).

=== Cinema ===
{{Main|Cinema of France}}
[[File:Cinématographe Lumière.jpg|thumb|World's first movie advertising for l'[[L'Arroseur Arrosé|Arroseur Arrosé]], 1895]]

France has historical and strong links with [[Filmmaking|cinema]]. It is two [[Frenchmen]], Auguste and Louis Lumière (known as the [[Lumiere Brothers]]) who created the cinema in 1895.<ref>{{fr}} [http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/personnage/Lumière/130661 Les frères Lumière]</ref> More recently, in 2006, France produced more films than any other European country.<ref>[http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/TableViewer/tableView.aspx Cinema: production of feature films] - UNESCO</ref> [[Cannes Festival]] is one of the most important and famous film festivals in the world.<ref>[http://www.cannesguide.com/basics/ Cannes - a festival virgin's guide] - CannesGuide</ref><ref>[http://www.whatsonwhen.com/sisp/index.htm?fx=event&event_id=21731 Cannes Film Festival] - www.whatsonwhen.com</ref> 

Although the French film market is dominated by [[Hollywood]], it is however the Western country (out of the United States) where the share of the American films in the total film revenues is the smallest, at 50,1%, to compare with 77,3% of Germany and 69,4% of Japan.<ref name = erudit>{{fr}} [http://www.erudit.org/revue/hphi/2005/v15/n2/801295ar.pdf] « Cinéma et diversité culturelle : le cinéma indépendant face à la mondialisation des industries
culturelles » - Erudit.org</ref> Thus, French films account for 34,8% of the total film revenues of France, which is the highest percentage of national films revenues in developed countries (the U.S. not included), to compare with 13,7% in Spain and 8,3% in the UK.<ref name = erudit/>

France was for centuries, and not so long ago, the cultural center of the world.<ref>[http://www.franceinlondon.co.uk/en-Article-335-Is-the-French-obsession-with-cultural-exception-declininge-Culture--london-language.html Is the French obsession with "cultural exception" declining?] - France in London</ref> But France's dominant position has been overthrown by [[american culture]], and thus France tries to protect its culture. France has been a strong advocate of the [[cultural exception]].<ref>[http://www.wolton.cnrs.fr/EN/collcom/ouvrages/fin_exc_cult.html The End of Cultural Exception ?] - [[CNRS]]</ref> France therefore succeeded in convincing all the EU members to refuse to include culture and audiovisuals in the list of liberalized sectors of the WTO in 1993.<ref>[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/actualites/politique/diversite/wto-en2.htm The cultural exception is not negotiable by Catherine Trautmann] - Ministry of Culture</ref>

Moreover, this decision was confirmed in a voting in the [[UNESCO]] in 2005, and the principle of "cultural exception" won an overwhelming victory : 198 countries voted for it, only 2 countries, the U.S and Israel, voted against it.<ref>{{fr}} [http://www.fnsac-cgt.com/administration/upload/ARTICLE%20UNESCO%20CONF%201602_06%20(3).pdf La Convention UNESCO pour la diversité culturelle : vers un droit international culturel contraignant ?] - www.fnsac-cgt.com</ref>
